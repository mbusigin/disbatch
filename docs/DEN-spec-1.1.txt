Disbatch is a multi-platform, multi-language, elastic, distributed batch
processing framework. This document outlines the protocol which a Disbatch
Execution Node (DEN) must follow to correctly operate with Disbatch Command
Nodes (DCN), as well as other DENs operating under the same
network/database.

OVERVIEW

Disbatch is a multi-platform, multi-language elastic distributed batch
processing framework. It heavily leverages MongoDB and JSON. The core
components are MongoDB, N-number of DENs (Disbatch Execution Nodes), and
potentially one or more DCNs (Disbatch Command Node).

Execution is split among queues, which are of homogenous type. Each queue
class is implemented as a plugin on the node. Nodes which poll for queues
that don't have requisite classes implemented are ignored.

MECHANICS

Each DEN is partitioned into queues. Each queue contains a pool of threads,
which are limited by the 'maxthreads' queue parameter on a per-node basis.

On DEN startup, the node registers itself, pulls the list of queues from the
MongoDB, which are created one-document per queue in the 'queues' collection.

TASK LIFECYCLE

A task is first created, generally on a DCN, either individually, or as a
result of a batch operation. Individual Tasks are saved to the 'tasks'
collection, with a reference back to the queue (by ObjectId) it sits under.
All tasks have a number of attributes in common: id, ctime, mtime, queue,
node, parameters, stdout, stderr, status.

The mechanism for creating the tasks is up to the implementor of the DCN, or
even through some other mechanism. It is their job to create tasks to this
specification so that DENs may execute them, and a DCN can provide an
interface into the data.

A task is created, initialised with parameters, its status set to Created,
and its node set to Unclaimed. Upon each Scheduling Interval, every DEN will
seek out these Created and Unclaimed tasks, putting them into a Pending and
Claimed state up until the per-node maximum thread threshold (Maxthreads) is
saturated.

When the DEN is ready, the Task is actually put into the Running status. The
plugin itself may report back status at any interval it likes, and it may
alter the task object any way it likes, but it is the responsibility of the
DEN to assure the status is up to date after it is complete, whether the
plugin has adjusted the status correctly or not.

DISBATCH EXECUTION NODE RESPONSIBILITIES

REQUIREMENTS

Each DEN:

	MUST have a unique Node ID

	MUST register itself via the DEN Node Registration Protocol

	MUST execute tasks via the DEN Task Execution Protocol

NODE ID

Node ID should be a short (1-8 characters), and follow the standard C identifier methdology:

[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z_0-9]*


STARTUP & INITIALISATION

Before a DEN starts processing tasks, it is obligated to clean up any tasks
that were not put into a completed state.


DEN NODE REGISTRATION PROTOCOL

Upon startup, each node must register itself to the Nodes collection. The
following elements must be included:

	_id:		ObjectId()				// Node ID,
	heartbeat:	{...}					// Heartbeat object (see
								   below)
	version:	"r-disbatch 1.21"			// Engine version string
	spec_version:	"1.0"					// DEN Specification
	queuetypes	[ { class: "Synacor::Migration::IMAP2IMAP",
			    version: '1.1a' }, .. ]		// Array of plugins enabled



HEARTBEAT OBJECT

The heartbeat object includes status updates on both the engine, as well as any queues active.

	datetime:	ISODate("2011-05-12T06:00:07Z")		// Heartbeat timestamp
	pid:		1234					// System PID
	queues:		[...]					// Queue heartbeat objects (see
								   below)

QUEUE HEARTBEAT OBJECT

All of this data is on a per-queue basis.

	class:		'Synacor::Migration::IMAP2IMAP'		// Plugin class
	queue:		ObjectId()				// Queue reference
	threads		50					// Thread count



FULL NODE JSON OBJECT EXAMPLE

{
	_id:		'mig01',
	version:	'Disbatch.pl v2.0.2',
	den_version:	'1.0',
	queuetypes:	[
				{
					class: 'Synacor::Migration::IMAP2IMAP',
					version: '1.1a'
				},
				{
					class: 'Synacor::Migration::Zimbra::UserImport',
					version: '0.9'
				}
			],
	heartbeat:	{
				datetime: ISODate("2011-05-12T06:00:07Z"),

				pid:		34182,
				queues: [
						{
							class: 'Synacor::Migration::IMAP2IMAP',
							queue: ObjectId(),
							threads: 50,
							idle: 15,
							processing: 35
						}
					]
			}
}


QUEUE DOCUMENT SPECIFICATION

The DENs will read from the "queues" collection, and can expect the following
format:

{
	_id:		'insight1'			// Queue ID,
	ctime:		ISODate("2011-05-12T06:00:07Z"),// Create time
	class:		'Synacor::Migration::IMAP2IMAP',// Class
	description:	'Insight Primary Migration',	// Description
	maxthreads:	50,				// Maximum per-node concurrency

	nodes_pin:	[ 'mig01', 'mig02' ],		// Pin queue to these nodes (and no-where else)
	nodes_ignore:	[ 'mig03', 'mig04' ]		// OR: ignore on these nodes
}

The "nodes_pin" and "nodes_ignore" attributes are mutually exclusive.  If
using pin, it is exclusive to the specified nodes.  If using ignore, it will
run on all nodes except for those specified.  If both are erroneously
provided, nodes_pin takes precedence over nodes_ignore.

Queue IDs can either be automatically generated, or provided as a uniquely
named user parameter.


TASK DOCUMENT SPECIFICATION

Each task the DEN pulls will be in the following format:

{
	_id:		ObjectId('238d892efadee'),
	queue:		'insight1',
	ctime:		ISODate("2011-05-12T06:00:07Z"),// Create time
	mtime:		ISODate("2011-05-12T06:00:07Z"),// Modify time
	parameters:	{ username: 'foo@foo.com', host: 'md08.foo.com' }, // Parameters
	stdout:		'',				// Your task output goes here
	stderr:		'',				// Your task errors go here
	status:		-2,				// Task status code (described below)
	node:		-1
}

TASK STATUS CODE

	-6:		Orphaned
	-5:		Cancelled
	-4:		Blocked
	-3:		Terminated
	-2:		Created
	-1:		Claimed
	0:		Running
	1:		Concluded
	2+:		Concluded with errors


TASK LIFECYCLE

Each task is initialised with its node as -1 (unclaimed) and status as -2 (created).

DENs can claim tasks from a queue one of two ways:

	1. findAndModify()
		where: queue: <queue> and node: -1 and status: -2
		set: node: <node> and status: -1 (or 0 if immediately processed)

or

	2. update()
		where: queue: <queue> and node: -1 and status: -2
		set: node: <node> and status: -1

	   <id> = find_one()
		where: queue: <queue> and node: <node> and status: -1

	   update()
		where: _id: <id>
		set: status: 0, mtime: now()


Both of these mechanisms ensure that there will be no race conditions amongst
DENs, even in a sharded or replicated MongoDB cluster.

The DEN thread running a task may update any non-specification attributes
whilst it is being executed.

When the DEN thread has concluded the task, it must update the task document:

{
	status: 1,
	stdout: 'Completion message',
	stderr: 'Errors',
	mtime: now()
}

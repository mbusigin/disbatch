Todo:
- write new web API
- figure out REST API / web authentication (multi-user)
- move some code from Disbatch::Web to Disbatch ??
- be able to use any type of task_runner (node.js, ruby, ...)
- instantiate plugins a better way:
  - This passing of the queue id is weird, but how Matt did it.
      $plugin->new({id => $queue_oid}, $doc->{parameters});
  - And this thing of setting $task->{workerthread} and $task->{id} is
    weird, as well:
      my $task = try {
          $plugin->new({id => $doc->{queue}}, $doc->{parameters});
      } catch {
          $logger->logdie($_);
      };
      $task->{workerthread} = $disbatch;
      $task->{id} = $oid;
- FIX: add an END or DESTROY block to task_runner to prevent orphaned
  status 0 tasks
